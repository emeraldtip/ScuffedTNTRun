Mäke noteblock ting make it into like an actual game
How? 
	Have the beats have an int that counts up every like beat or something
	and then have some beats to check notes on.
	Maybe under the noteblock check have like a thing that detects if a certain noteblock needs to be played.
	Then with that run a function for each block separately and check if they have to be played.
	Since each beat is every 10 ticks then we can have a +-3 tick thing that in that range it will count.
